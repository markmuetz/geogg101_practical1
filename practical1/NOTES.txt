So far:

* run all calibration (came up with n=0.025 as optimum value)
* run the dredged scenario, calculated diffs and exported all data:
    * dredging_effect_with_nice_headers.txt
    * dredging_effect_with_column_headers.txt
* plotted the values

Observations:

Graphs:
* The vel mag across the dredged channel is slightly lower
* The water surface elevation is almost unchanged
* Mid-estuary and Upstream vel mags are essentially unchanged after dredging
* Dredged vel mags are lower for Berth, Inlet, the diff is greatest for Berth

SMS:
There is a small 'hotspot' just upstream of the dredged channel where dredged
is faster. Otherwise it is slower.
